<strong><u>Part 1 of 4: Visual Studio Community introduction</u></strong><strong><u> </u></strong>

Complete the Visual Studio project creation and Hello World program using the Visual Studio 2019 IDE (Integrated Development Environment)See the CP4P_Week1_VS_2019 demo.docx within the zip file.

<strong><em>The Visual Studio Community IDE used and needed for the C programming course runs <u>only</u> under a Windows operating system</em></strong><em>. There is a “Visual Studio for macOS” and “Visual Studio Code” for all OSs but the VS products are similar in name only, not in substance. (Microsoft would not maintain three different products if they were all the same.) By a wide margin, Visual Studio IDE is used by professional developers; VS supports many target environments, not just Microsoft Windows platforms.</em>

Remove all the instructions before you submit. Keep only the èquestions and your answers.  (<strong>Delete this line and all that came before it.)</strong>

è Your name:                   Student No.:                        UserID: <u>         </u>@mySeneca.ca

è Where does Visual Studio store your helloWorld.c source file? Find the file and paste it’s Full Path in the box:




<em>(Hints at using File Explorer to find your Visual Studio project’s files are in the VS demo document.)</em>

è What is the content within the helloWorld.c file? Your source code, of course.<em>Copy the text of your customized source statements from the Visual Studio editor and paste in the box below using the Paste Option to either Merge Formatting (M) or Keep Text Only (T).</em>




<em>N.B. there is no need to submit the VS project or the .c source file itself with this week’s activity…just your C code above.</em>

<strong><u>Part 2 of 4: Proper naming convention and having correct file extensions</u></strong><strong><u> </u></strong>

<strong>Four files can be found in the “CP4P_Week1_Activity_WorkFiles” subfolder. Those files all have the wrong file extension. Your task is to add the correct extension to those file names so the system can properly process those files.</strong>

<ul>

 <li><strong>IF</strong> the filename extensions are <strong>not</strong> being displayed in File Explorer:</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Press Alt-V to activate the View menu:</li>

 <li>Click to turn on the display of“File name extensions”</li>

</ol>

Normally, when you right-click a file, a number of options are available to process that file. E.g. Preview, Open, Open with &gt; [optional applications]. These options are based on the file’s extension which the system relates to an application. Double clicking a file name opens it using the default application.

file<strong>.txt     </strong><strong>ð</strong><strong>  </strong>Notepad                    file<strong>.html  </strong><strong>ð</strong><strong>  </strong>Web Browserfile<strong>.bmp  </strong><strong>ð</strong><strong>  </strong>Paint graphics         file<strong>.jpg     </strong><strong>ð</strong><strong>  </strong>Windows Picture Viewer

If there is a problem with the data within the file, the default application may issue an error message or, as many manuals say, “results may be unpredictable”.

Click and drag the file from File Explorer and drop it into a browser; any browser can render any of these file types but only if the file’s content matches its file extension. Firefox gives the best feedback when there is a problem. If nothing happens when you click and drag, you are probably dragging a compressed file from the .zip. Software applications work only with uncompressed file data.

è Describe what happens and what you see when the file is dropped into Firefox (preferred) or any other browser. It will not be as expected from the file extension.

lunamoth.jpg à

lunamoth.txt à

lunamoth.bmp à

<strong>To see the file’s data which is causing problems, open those files with Notepad to inspect their content: </strong>Start Notepad (ÿ + “Notepad”), Open the file (Ctrl+O or File / Open) or just click and drag the file from File Explorer and drop into Notepad. This will display the file’s binary data as characters. Examine the raw data and determine what the file’s extension should be.

<ul>

 <li>Text files (.txt) can contain any characters but usually contain human readable information formatted with little more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key">TAB</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">newline</a> special characters.</li>

 <li>Web pages are text files with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong></a> (.html, .htm) that browsers use to display content. Visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Markup">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Markup</a> to see what HTML files look like.</li>

 <li>Find out what a <strong>JPEG</strong> (.jpg) photo file and a <strong>bitmap</strong> (.bmp) graphics file begin with. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures</a> for data used to identify the content of a file.</li>

</ul>

Now, rename each file <strong>adding</strong> the proper extension until all four files are opened correctly by their default applications. e.g. rename <strong>lunamoth.bmp</strong> to<strong> lunamoth.bmp.<u>???</u></strong> in order to keep track of which extension was renamed to another extension. Only the last extension on a file’s name is used by the operating system.

è What are the new names of the files?

lunamoth.html.<em>???</em>

lunamoth.jpg.<em>???</em>

lunamoth.txt.<em>???</em>

lunamoth.bmp.<em>???</em>

è What does this experience tell you about the importance of file names and their extensions? Did the renaming of these files have an effect on the data contained within the files? <strong> </strong>

<strong><u>Part 3: Working with a removable USB drive and a local drive while doing common file/directory operations </u></strong>

<ul>

 <li>Open File Explorer and navigate to your folder containing the above Week 1 files.</li>

</ul>

In the left hand pane within the folder tree and using right-click…

<ul>

 <li>Create a new folder somewhere on the C: drive, e.g. under Desktop or Downloads.</li>

 <li>Create a new folder on another drive, e.g. your USB drive or the D: drive on a lab PC if you don’t have a USB drive (<em>get one soon</em>)</li>

</ul>

è What happens to the files (not their content) when you select the lunamoth files in your original folder, then drag and drop them in the new folder on your <strong>USB drive or the D: drive, i.e. when the target drive is <em>different</em> from the source drive</strong>…are the files MOVED or COPIED?

è What happens to the files (not their content) when you select the lunamoth files in your original folder, then drag and drop them in the new folder on the <strong>C: drive, i.e. when dragging to a different folder within the <em>same</em> drive</strong>…are the files MOVED or COPIED?

è What happens when you drop a file while holding the Ctrl key and releasing the Left mouse button?

Programmers almost always click, drag, and drop using the <strong>right</strong> mouse button.è What happens when you drag and drop a file using <strong>right</strong> mouse button?




è After deleting a file from the PC’s internal drive, can you restore it? If so, how?

è How do you delete a file from a PC permanently so it cannot be recovered?

è After deleting a file from your USB drive, i.e. an external drive, can you restore it? If so, how?

<strong><u>Part 4: Backing up your files</u></strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>A backup is two copies in separate geographic locations on independent systems.</strong>

Use the browser to open the <strong>Content System</strong> in Blackboard

It is a simple repository where you can store folders and files.

If you see this message: Sorry! We can’t access your Content Collection due to a permissions issue. Please ask your administrator for help. then please go to the Service Desk in the SEQ building Learning Centre, tell them about this, and ask them to check your account’s authorities.

Storage is also available by going to <strong>mySeneca.ca</strong> and opening Office 365’s OneDrive.Click on the grid in the top left to open the menu and click on OneDrive.For the next question, if you do not have a USB drive with you, just work with OneDrive and the Content System.

è Can you edit a text, source code, and/or MS Office file stored…

<ul>

 <li>directly on your USB drive?

  <ul>

   <li>If so, how? If not, what must you do to edit a file stored there?</li>

  </ul></li>

<ul>

 <li>directly in the Blackboard Content System?

  <ul>

   <li>If so, how? If not, what must you do to edit a file stored there?</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>




You can store and work with your Visual Studio projects (in <strong>repos</strong> or <strong>Projects</strong> folder) directly on a USB drive or your Office 365 OneDrive at Seneca.

è It takes effort to copy files and directories from a USB drive or the Content System or OneDrive to the local drive, work with and save them locally, and then transfer the local files back. Is it worth the effort? Why or Why not? What are the benefits and risks in having the same file on your local system and on a removeable drive or remote system?

<strong>Create a backup: make two copies of today’s files in separate geographic locations on independent systems</strong> both of which are not on the lab machine you might be using now. If using your own PC/laptop, you need <em>at least</em> one backup.

To back up all your Visual Studio work, compress/7zip the <strong>repos</strong> or <strong>Projects</strong> folder (with its sub-folders) into an archive and copy/move the archive file to a geographically separate system.

You can work with your Visual Studio projects directly on your own laptop, a USB drive, a personal OneDrive, or your Office 365 OneDrive. Make <em>one</em> of those your standard practice. Choose a different one for your backup. To distinguish the back up from your active version, put the repo into a zip file.

è What are the two locations of your backup?




N.B. bidirectional synchronization of your PC’s files with a cloud data service makes your system <em>interdependent</em> with the cloud; the synchronization is convenient but the systems are not independent. Although separated by geography, you have one file coexisting in two places. That is neither a copy nor a backup until you disconnect from the cloud service – only then are the two systems independent. As soon as you reconnect, files are sync’d and you once again have neither a copy nor a backup. If a file is deleted in one system, it will be deleted from all other sync’d systems.

<strong>Make sure you have a proper backup before restarting or shutting down a Seneca lab PC – when it starts, the PC is reset to its default state. That is, all files from the previous session are gone. </strong>At the start of term, it is worth confirming that that the PC is correctly configured: the D drive should indeed be temporary, and C:Users should have retained none of your files.

<strong>USB flash drives are wonderfully portable which makes them easily losable. </strong>If you do lose your drive, usually by forgetting it in the lab PC, how will it ever get back to you?

<em>Little Bo-Bleephas lost her USB-flash-drive-with-files-on-each-of-her sheep,And doesn’t know where to find it;Without her name,Home ne’er it came,But would have if she had signed it.</em>

(Sadly, she didn’t have a backup.)

<ul>

 <li>Rename your USB drive’s volume label to your name.</li>

 <li>Put a <strong>!!_PLEASE_RETURN_TO_!!.txt</strong> file in the root with your email address, contact information, and a nice message promising a reward coffee.</li>

 <li>Put your name on the outside of the USB drive.</li>

 <li>And it just might come home wagging its data behind it.</li>

</ul>
